Project 5 including PowerBI data analytics.


## How to use this project

This project allows a user a high-level interface with data relating to registered devices in an IOT database. This allows a user to see various graphs relating to the devices and where they are located, if they are active or how many devices were registered in a certain time span. These graphs can then be filtered down to user specification using the filters located to the right of the graphs. These filters are applied to all the reports.
